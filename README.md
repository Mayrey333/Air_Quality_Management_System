JUST AQ is a comprehensive approach to air quality monitoring and prediction, aimed at safeguarding public health, preserving the environment, ensuring regulatory compliance, and fostering sustainable development. Air quality, crucial for our well-being, faces escalating challenges globally, with pollution levels soaring in urban and rural areas alike. JUST AQ steps in as a beacon of hope, leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze complex relationships between various pollutants and predict air quality levels with unprecedented accuracy.

In today's world, where every breath counts, JUST AQ emerges as a shield against the omnipresent threat of air pollution. This project stands at the forefront, providing real-time monitoring of air quality and offering predictive insights into future trends. With each data point and prediction, we edge closer to a future where clean air is not just a luxury but a fundamental right for all. JUST AQ empowers individuals and communities to take proactive measures, ensuring their health and safety amidst the challenges posed by air pollution.

Air Quality Index (AQI) serves as our yardstick, ranging from 0 to 500, indicating the level of air pollution and associated health risks. By continuously monitoring AQI and providing timely alerts, JUST AQ enables societies to strive towards cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable living environments.

Our objectives are clear: to develop a system for real-time air quality monitoring and prediction, leveraging historical data and machine learning models. By integrating time series forecasting techniques like ARIMA and FBprophet, to provide accurate predictions and timely alerts, enhancing the efficiency of air quality management. Additionally, our system will analyze the relationship between AQI and pollutants using regression models, enabling healthcare providers to anticipate and prepare for potential health issues arising from poor air quality.

To evaluate the efficacy of our system, we employ metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics provide insights into how well our models fit the observed data and the average magnitude of errors in predictions.

Geographic analysis is crucial for understanding the spatial patterns of air quality in 2015 and 2020. This analysis involved creating a dual map with two layers: one displaying the average AQI data for 2015 and the other for 2020. By comparing AQI data between these two years, trends in air quality over time in different regions, particularly in Delhi, could be identified. This analysis helped determine whether air quality had improved, deteriorated, or remained stable in various regions over the specified period. The data, merged from two datasets, provided insights into the average AQI for each city across the years 2015-2020. The resulting dual map showcased cities with high average AQI values in 2015 represented by larger red circles and cities with moderate to low average AQI values in 2020 represented by smaller blue circles. This comparison revealed a decrease in average AQI values from 2015 to 2020, indicating an improvement in air quality over time, possibly due to increased awareness and interventions addressing air pollution.
